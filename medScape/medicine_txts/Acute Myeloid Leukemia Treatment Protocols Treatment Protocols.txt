Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment Protocols: Treatment Protocols
Treatment protocols for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are provided below, including a general treatment approach and treatment recommendations for relapsed or refractory disease.
 [1] 
Fit patients (< 60-65 years, select patients up to age 75 y) receive intensive therapy. Treatment includes induction therapy and postremission therapy (consolidation). Non–low-risk patients are evaluated for stem cell transplantation in first remission.
Less-fit patients (70-75 years and older, or younger patients with significant comorbidities) receive low-intensity therapy. Select less-fit patients with highly proliferative disease may be considered for intensive therapy
Induction therapy
The combination of cytarabine with an anthracycline or anthracenedione is recommended.
 [2, 3, 4, 5] Note the following:
Cytarabine 100-200 mg/m2 continuous IV infusion for 7d plus
Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day for 3d or daunorubicin 60-90 mg/m2/day for 3d
Follow-up bone marrow to assess remission is typically done 7-14d after completion of induction chemotherapy, except in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) (see APL guidelines)
 [6] 
Fixed-dose combination cytarabine/daunorubicin liposomal for newly diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) is as follows:
Regimens combining high-dose cytarabine with anthracycline/anthracenedione are as follows
 [7, 8] :
Cytarabine 2-3 g/m2 q12h for 3d plus  idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day for 3d for one cycle or
Cytarabine 2-3 g/m2 q12h for 3d plus  daunorubicin 45-60 mg/m2 day for 3d for one cycle
 [6] 
For newly diagnosed AML that is FLT3 mutation positive, midostaurin may be included, as follows:
Cladribine-based therapy is as follows:
Cytarabine 200 mg/m2 continuous infusion for 7d plus  daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 for 3d plus cladribine 5 mg/m2 for 5d
 [10] 
In adults with newly diagnosed de novo CD33-positive AML, combination therapy that includes gemtuzumab consists of one induction and two consolidation cycles, as follows:
A treatment course of gemtuzumab as a single agent for adults with newly-diagnosed CD33-positive AML consists of the following:
Postremission therapy (consolidation) 
 [2, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] :
All patients should be assessed for risk of relapse. Specific drug regimens are recommended based on a patient’s risk of relapse.
Better-risk patients
Cytogenetics [inv(16) or t(16;16), t(8;21)] and molecular abnormalities (normal cytogenetics: with NPM 1 mutation or isolated CEBPA mutation in the absence of FLT3-ITD):
High-dose cytarabine 3 g/m2 IV over 3h every 12h on days 1, 3, and 5 for four cycles
 [6]  or
High-dose cytarabine 3 g/m2 IV over 3h every 12h on days 1, 3, and 5 for two cycles plus  autologous stem cell transplantation
 [6] 
Intermediate-risk patients:
Cytogenetics [normal cytogenetics, +8, t(9;11), other nondefined] and molecular abnormalities [normal cytogenetics: t(8;21), inv(16), t(16;16): with c-KIT mutation]:
High-dose cytarabine 3 g/m2 IV over 3h every 12h on days 1, 3, and 5 for four cycles, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation
High-risk patients:
Cytogenetics [complex (≥3 clonal chromosomal abnormalities), -5, 5q-, -7, 7q-, 11q23 - non t(9;11), inv(3), t(3;3), t(6;9), t(9;22)] and molecular abnormalities (normal cytogenetics: FLT3-ITD mutation), prior antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD):
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation or
Clinical trial or
High-dose cytarabine 3 g/m2 IV over 3h every 12h on days 1, 3, and 5; if clinical trial not available or
High-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 every 12 h on days 1, 3, and 5) plus  midostaurin 50 mg PO BID on days 8-21 of each 28-day cycle for up to four consolidation cycles, followed by  continuous midostaurin
 [9] 
New regimens:
Fixed-dose combination cytarabine/daunorubicin liposomal for newly diagnosed therapy-related (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) is as follows:
Daunorubicin 29 mg/m² plus cytarabine 65 mg/m² liposome IV on days 1 and 3
Initiate the first consolidation cycle 5-8 weeks after the start of the last induction cycle 
 [22] 
Treatment recommendations for patients ≥60y
 [23, 24, 25, 26] :
There is no standard therapy for this patient population; a clinical trial is preferred
The following low-intensity therapies are recommended for patients ≥60y: azacytidine 75 mg/m2 IV or SC for 7d every 4-5wk or decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV daily for 5d every 4-5wk or low-dose cytarabine 20 mg SC BID for 10d every 4wk
In patients with a high WBC count (especially > 30,000/μL) who are unlikely to respond to low-intensity therapy, consider therapies as in younger patients; however, tolerance and response may be poor
See the list below:
Recommended chemotherapy regimens for relapsed or refractory disease
Mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine (MEC)
 [29] :
CLAG-M (cladribine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and filgrastim)
 [30] :
FLAG-IDA (fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin, and filgrastim)
 [31] :
For relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML (single-agent regimen)
 [11] :
For relapsed or refractory IDH-positive AML:
For relapsed or refractory FLT3-positive AML
 [34] :

 [37] 
Venetoclax plus azacitidine (28-day cycle)
 [38] 
Venetoclax plus decitabine (28-day cycle)
