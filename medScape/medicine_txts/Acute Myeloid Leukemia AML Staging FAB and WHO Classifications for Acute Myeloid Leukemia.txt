Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Staging: FAB and WHO Classifications for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Two staging systems are commonly used for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The French-American-British (FAB) classification system is based on morphology to define specific immunotypes. The World Health Organization (WHO) classification reviews chromosome translocations and evidence of dysplasia.
