Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia Staging: Diagnostic Studies
Recommended diagnostic studies to evaluate a suspected diagnosis of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma are as follows
 [1] :
Optional studies, if clinically indicated, include the following:
Kastritis et al developed and validated an updated international prognostic score system for Waldenström macroglobulinemia.
 [2]  The system uses the following criteria:
Based on the total score, the system classifies patients into 5 risk groups (see table 1 below).
