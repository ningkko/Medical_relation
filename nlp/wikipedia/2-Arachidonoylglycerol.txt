ag is an endocannabinoid an endogenous agonist of the cb receptor and the primary endogenous ligand for the cb receptor it is an ester formed from the omega fatty acid arachidonic acid and glycerol it is present at relatively high levels in the central nervous system with cannabinoid neuromodulatory effects it has been found in maternal bovine and human milk the chemical was first described in although it had been discovered some time before that the activities of phospholipase plc and diacylglycerol lipase dagl mediate its formation ag is synthesized from arachidonic acid containing diacylglycerol dag occurrence ag unlike anandamide another endocannabinoid is present at relatively high levels in the central nervous system it is the most abundant molecular species of found in mouse and rat brain nmol tissue detection of ag in brain tissue is complicated by the relative ease of its isomerization to ag during standard lipid extraction conditions it has been found in maternal bovine as well as human milk discovery ag was discovered by raphael mechoulam and his student shimon ben shabat ag was known chemical compound but its occurrence in mammals and its affinity for the cannabinoid receptors were first described in research group at teikyo university reported the affinity of ag for the cannabinoid receptors in but the isolation of ag in the canine gut was first reported in by the research group of raphael mechoulam at the hebrew university of jerusalem which additionally characterized its pharmacological properties in vivo next with anandamide was the second endocannabinoid discovered the cannabinoid established the existence of cannabinoid neuromodulatory system in the nervous system pharmacology unlike anandamide formation of ag is calcium dependent and is mediated by the activities of phospholipase plc and diacylglycerol lipase dagl ag acts as full agonist at the cb receptor at concentration of nm ag induces rapid transient increase in intracellular free calcium in ng neuroblastoma glioma cells through cb receptor dependent mechanism ag is hydrolyzed in vitro by lipase magl fatty acid amide hydrolase faah and the uncharacterized serine hydrolase enzymes abhd and abhd the exact contribution of each of these enzymes to the termination of ag signaling in vivo is unknown though it is estimated that magl is responsible for of this activity in the brain there have been identified transport proteins for and anandamide these include the heat shock proteins hsp and fatty acid binding proteins fabps biosynthesis is synthesized from arachidonic acid containing diacylglycerol dag which is derived from the increase of inositol phospholipid metabolism by the action of diacylglycerol lipase the molecule can also be formed from pathways like the hydrolysis derived by diglyceride from both pc and phosphatidic acid pas by the action of dag lipase and the hydrolysis of arachidonic acid containing acid by the action of phosphatase see also arachidonoyl glyceryl ether endocannabinoid transporters references notes general references
