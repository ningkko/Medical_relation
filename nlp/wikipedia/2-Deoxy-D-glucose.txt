deoxy glucose is glucose molecule which has the hydroxyl group replaced by hydrogen so that it cannot undergo further glycolysis as such it acts to competitively inhibit the production of glucose phosphate from glucose at the level step of glycolysis in most cells glucose hexokinase phosphorylates deoxyglucose trapping the product deoxyglucose phosphate intracellularly with exception of liver and kidney thus labelled forms of deoxyglucose serve as good marker for tissue glucose uptake and hexokinase activity many cancers have elevated glucose uptake and hexokinase levels deoxyglucose labeled with tritium or carbon has been popular ligand for laboratory research in animal models where distribution is assessed by tissue slicing followed by autoradiography sometimes in tandem with either conventional or electron microscopy dg is uptaken by the glucose transporters of the cell therefore cells with higher glucose uptake for example tumor cells have also higher uptake of dg since dg hampers cell growth its use as tumor therapeutic has been suggested and in fact dg is in clinical trials recent clinical trial showed dg can be tolerated at dose of mg kg day however the observed cardiac side effects prolongation of the interval at this dose and the fact that majority of patients cancer progressed casts doubt on the feasibility of this reagent for further clinical use however it is not completely clear how dg inhibits cell growth the fact that glycolysis is inhibited by dg seems not to be sufficient to explain why dg treated cells stop growing clinicians have noted that dg is metabolised in the pentose phosphate pathway in red blood cells at least although the significance of this for other cell types and for cancer treatment in general is unclear work on the ketogenic diet as treatment for epilepsy have investigated the role of glycolysis in the disease deoxyglucose has been proposed by garriga canut et al as mimic for the ketogenic diet and shows great promise as new anti epileptic drug the authors suggest that dg works in part by increasing the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf nerve growth factor ngf arc protein arc and basic fibroblast growth factor fgf such uses are complicated by the fact that deoxyglucose does have some toxicity study found that by combining the sugar deoxy glucose dg with fenofibrate compound that has been safely used in humans for more than years to lower cholesterol and triglycerides an entire tumor could effectively be targeted without the use of toxic chemotherapy dg has been used as targeted optical imaging agent for fluorescent in vivo imaging in clinical medical imaging pet scanning is used where one of the hydrogens of deoxy glucose is replaced with the positron emitting isotope fluorine which emits paired gamma rays allowing distribution of the tracer to be imaged by external gamma camera this is increasingly done in tandem with ct function which is part of the same pet ct machine to allow better localization of small volume tissue glucose uptake differences references
