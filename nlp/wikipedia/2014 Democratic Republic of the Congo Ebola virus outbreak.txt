in an outbreak of ebola virus disease in the democratic republic of the congo drc occurred genome sequencing has shown that this outbreak was not related to the west africa ebola virus epidemic but was of the same ebov species it began in august and was declared over in november of that year after days without any new cases this is the th outbreak there three of which occurred during the period of zaire epidemiology index patient the outbreak was traced to woman living in ikanamongo village in the remote northern équateur province who fell ill after handling bushmeat despite treatment in local clinic the woman died on august at the time of her death her diagnosis was hemorrhagic fever of unknown etiology subsequent laboratory studies confirmed she had died of ebola virus disease response medecins sans frontieres doctors without borders msf deployed team of staff to the area and opened two treatment centres with combined capacity of beds msf together with the country ministry of health and the world health organization who worked to heighten public awareness and ensure that surveillance contact tracing and follow up activities were carried out in order to limit the spread of the disease there are no roads to the affected area which made working conditions difficult subsequent cases by august people including three health care workers were reported to have died of ebola like symptoms in équateur province province that lies about north of the capital kinshasa on august the équateur province ministry of health confirmed an outbreak of ebola to the who on september the who said that there were currently deaths in the northern boende area in the province of équateur and confirmed suspected or likely cases on september the who raised the number of cases to and the death toll to from possible or confirmed ebola cases included in this number were health care workers with deaths among them in total contacts were listed and contacts were being followed the outbreak was still contained in jeera county in the boende region as of october there had been cases reported in total deaths had been reported including eight among health care workers no new reported contacts were being followed and twenty days had passed since the last reported case tested negative for the second time and was discharged it was stated that the drc would therefore be declared free of ebola disease days after the date of the second negative test if no new cases were reported the outbreak was declared over on november subsequent findings in october it was reported that more recent findings suggested that there may have been several previous cases the husband of the woman that was believed to have been the index case told an investigation team that shortly before she became ill she had visited two women who later died from ebola like symptoms other village residents also told the team that all the pigs in the village had died just before the illness hit the village and they had eaten the pigs according to the research team it was the third time after and that widespread pig deaths had preceded ebola outbreaks in humans in the dr congo and it has been established that the pigs that died in carried the ebola virus pig to human transmission has never been proven in previous outbreaks but villagers have been told to avoid eating them and the investigation is ongoing virology ebola virions results from virus sequencing of samples from the ebola outbreak in the democratic republic of congo have shown that the virus is the zaire species in lineage most closely related to virus from the ebola outbreak in kikwit the zaire species of the virus is indigenous to the area when the outbreak was first reported there were fears that an ongoing epidemic in west africa may have spread to the drc however results from virus together with findings from the epidemiological investigation showed that the outbreak in drc is distinct and independent event with no relationship to the outbreak in west africa history scientists wearing personal protective equipment ppe testing samples for the ebola virus from animals collected in zaire this was the country seventh ebola outbreak since the first case of ebola disease ever recorded occurred in august in yambuku small village in mongala district in northern democratic republic of the congo then known as zaire the first victim of the disease was the village school headmaster who had toured an area near the central african republic border along the ebola river in mid august on september he died of what would become known as ebola virus disease subsequently number of other cases were reported almost all centered on the yambuku mission hospital or having close contact with other cases total of cases and deaths an fatality rate resulted from this outbreak which along with an outbreak in sudan that had begun few weeks previously were the first outbreaks of ebola ever recorded the virus responsible for the initial outbreak named after the nearby ebola river was first thought to be marburg virus but was later identified as new type of virus related to marburg second major outbreak of ebola occurred in kikwit in it affected killing in there was an outbreak that affected and killed death rate of the highest ebola death rate ever recorded up to that date the table below
