ipomeanol ipo is pulmonary pre toxin isolated from sweet potatoes infected with the fungus fusarium solani one of the ipo metabolites is toxic to the lungs liver and kidney in humans and animals this metabolite can covalently bind to proteins thereby interfering with normal cell processes the toxic metabolite an enedial is mostly formed in the bronchiolar exocrine cells club cells in the lungs of rodents necrosis of bronchiolar cells is therefore the primary damaging effect of the toxin due to this location of metabolism the secondary pathological effects are edema congestion and hemorrhage caused by the destruction of the bronchiolar exocrine cells in humans the metabolite is mostly formed in the liver and causes liver toxicity structure and reactivity ipomeanol is chemical compound belonging to the family of furans it consists of furan ring which is substituted at the third carbon of the furan ring with pentanone containing hydroxyl group furan ring is five membered aromatic ring consisting of one oxygen atom and four carbon atoms pentanone is ketone consisting of five carbon atoms other substituted furans are ipomeanine ipn ipomeanol ipo and ipomeanol diol differing in the locations of the hydroxyl groups ipo has three functional groups which determine the molecule reactivity these are the furan ring the ketone group and the alcohol group reactivity of furan ring the furan ring is aromatic according to h√ºckel rule so the furan makes the compound relatively stable therefore this ring will not react easily with other compounds furan is heterocyclic which means that it is cyclic but one or more of the ring atoms is not carbon atom in the case of furan this heteroatom is an oxygen atom this atom is sp hybridized and has one lone pair in an sp orbital and second lone pair in orbital overlapping with the orbitals of adjacent carbons this results in pi bond formation reactivity of ketone ketone group is polar as oxygen is more electronegative than carbon therefore the carbonyl atom of the ketone group is electron deficient thus electrophilic and can easily react with nucleophiles however it does not undergo substitution reactions as the attached molecule is too strong base to be eliminated as result of this irreversible nucleophilic addition reactions are possible nucleophile can add to the carbonyl carbon but due to the lack of good leaving group no base is eliminated this intermediate molecule takes up proton so hydroxyl group is formed when there is sufficient acid present the hydroxyl group can be protonated further making it good leaving group this functional group will then react as an alcohol group as described above is the basic reaction mechanism of ketones in this way ketones can undergo several organic reactions reacting with compounds like grignard reagents acetylide cyanide and hydride ions amines water alcohols and peroxyacids reactivity of alcohol the alcohol group is strongly basic leaving group that cannot undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions however it becomes better leaving group after protonation which converts the leaving group from oh to is weaker base than oh and can thus undergo substitution reactions with weakly basic nucleophiles this reaction occurs following sn mechanism as ipo is secondary alcohol dehydration of the at the pentanone substituted alcohol group is also possible following an reaction mechanism this reaction is acid catalyzed and results in the loss of water molecule like with the sn reaction protonation of the leaving group is required first water then is eliminated leaving behind carbocation which leads eventually to alkene formation furthermore secondary alcohols can undergo oxidation reactions this results in the formation of ketone synthesis left ipo can be isolated from sweet potatoes infected with the fungus fusarium solani however it can also be synthesized from the commercially available chemical diethyl partial hydrolysis of diethyl with an equimolar quantity of naoh results in the monoester ethoxycarbonyl furan carboxylic acid ii occurs this is followed by decarboxylation by heating with copper powder yielded ethyl furoate iii the claisen condensation is used to form ethyl furoylacetate iv by reacting with propylene oxide lactone is formed decarboxylation is achieved by gently heating lactone in the presence of diluted acid vi metabolism metabolic activation of ipo occurs by one of the enzymes of the cytochrome cyp superfamily the oxidation of the furan ring leads to the formation of an unstable epoxide cyclic ester with three atom ring so an alkylating intermediate species ipo enedial is formed in rodents it is cyp that activates ipo an enzyme of the cyp family of which the cyp subfamily is involved in the fatty acid metabolism cyp is present in high levels in the lungs and its affinity for ipo is greater than for liver cyp enzymes therefore the activated form of ipo is mainly toxic to the lungs in rodents schematic illustrating bioactivation versus inactivation routes for ipo after either or uridine diphospho mediated metabolism however in humans the reactivity of cyp is different and it does not activate ipo the cyp enzymes cyp and cyp are active in the liver and are similar to the rodent cyp ipo is thus metabolically activated by cyp and cyp in humans these two enzymes are both part of several pathways involved in the drug metabolism as both cyps are mainly active in the liver ipo causes hepatotoxicity in humans in both rodents and humans phase metabolism involves the of ipo into an epoxide intermediate by cyps this epoxide is unstable so it degrades into an enedial intermediate the enedial intermediate is toxic as it can bind to proteins however it can be detoxified in phase ii metabolism in which the enedial can be conjugated with either acetyl lysine nal or acetyl cysteine nac this results in nal nac ipo adduct which can be excreted furthermore ipo can directly undergo phase ii metabolism by conjugating glucuronosyl to the hydroxyl group of ipo by uridine diphospho ugt forming ipo glucuronide this can like the nal nac ipo adduct be excreted however the major pathway involves the enedial intermediate and the nal nac ipo adduct is the major product of in contrast with these findings of in vivo studies several other pathways for of ipo are found in vitro in vitro microsomal incubation of ipo and its gsh adducts as products next to oxidation of the furan ring of ipo so that the ipo enedial is formed the hydroxyl group of ipo can be oxidized oxidation of this functional group leads to ketone formation so ipn is formed ipn can undergo oxidation of the furan ring by cyps like ipo after this bioactivation reaction the product can be conjugated to glutathione gsh by glutathione transferase gst furthermore ipo can be reduced and diol is the product of this finally ipo can interact with nadp forming molecule which contains ipo and nadph of these four pathways described the oxidation to ipn and the reduction to diol are the major processes next to the difference in possible metabolic reactions ipo can undergo there is also difference in the metabolization of the reactive ipo enedial this compound can be metabolized by either ugt or gsh metabolization by ugt results in nal nac ipo adducts while multiple products can be the result of gsh metabolism interaction of the ipo enedial with gsh leads both to michael adduct and adduct the michael adduct is the product of michael addition addition of cysteine of the cysteine in gsh at the position of the enedial this michael adduct can undergo dehydration and forms via tricyclic pyrroline adduct mono gsh pyrrole adduct another reaction the michael adduct can undergo is again dehydration and conjugation with gsh via the formation of subsequently an imine enamine and an iminium ion bis gsh pyrrole adduct is formed another reaction via which the michael adduct can form bis gsh pyrrole adduct is firstly by undergoing elimination of ketone group followed by again dehydration in combination with gsh conjugation the adduct can also undergo dehydration in combination with gsh conjugation in similar way as the michael adduct which results in bis gsh pyrrole adduct furthermore the can dehydrate and form mono gsh pyrrole adduct pharmacological use distribution of ipo across tissues shows the same patterns for intravenous oral and intraperitoneal injection and peak concentrations are achieved one to two hours after administration by then most of the ipo will be located in the lungs followed by liver kidney and blood apart from having the highest ipo concentration lung cells also show the highest level of covalently bound ipo this is in contrast with the gut where the most occurring form of ipo is unbound after four hours ipo levels show plateau which persists for hours ipo molecules still present at that time are mostly bound to other macromolecules the ic was determined by an automated cell culture growth inhibition assay which shows ic ranging from mm depending on the cell type the ic was also determined by another group which found roughly the same detoxification is suspected to occur primarily via glucuronidation of ipo out of all the metabolites found in urine the primary excretion pathway ipo glucuronide was the most abundant excretion of ipo glucuronide can be increased when rats were treated with phenobarbital which increases aminobutyric acid gaba activity half life varies from species to species in mice the half life is approximately minutes after intravenous injection of mg kg ipo this is lower in rats and dogs rats need around six minutes to reduce the ipo concentration by half and dogs around ten minutes both were administered single intravenous dose of mg kg preclinical trials several in vitro experiments were performed to explore the possible uses of ipo which showed promising results different lung ovarian breast and melanoma cancer cell lines showed apoptosis or inhibited tumor growth when exposed to high levels of ipo ug ul these results could not be replicated in conventional cancer screens probably due to the fact that ipo metabolism relies on very specific enzymes and environments which could not be replicated by conventional screens however ipo showed effects when exposed to human lung cell lines four cell lines were tested and two showed inhibited tumor growth both cell lines were non small cell lung carcinoma while the two cell lines with no effects were small cell tumors other experiments showed that ipo reduced tumor growth in tumor assay at concentration of mg ml furthermore covalent binding of ipo intermediates was observed in fresh lung biopsies phase trial on the basis of this knowledge phase trial was performed to study the effects of ipo on the human body men and women with non small cell lung cancer were tested the trial showed no significant hematological or renal toxicity but also no effect on the tumor measurements with biopsies obtained from the patients showed an ic of mm which is around times higher than the measured plasma concentrations and likely higher than the plasma concentration achievable in vivo phase ii trial an earlier phase and pharmacological trial showed that hepatotoxicity is dose limiting in humans and not lung toxicity based on these results phase ii trial was conducted to test the effects of ipo on patients with advanced measurable hepatocellular carcinoma nineteen patients were treated with mg m¬≤ ipo one patient showed brief reduction in metastasis in the lung but the rest showed no significant effects as consequence the authors recommend that ipo is not used for further testing further use in cancer treatment recently ipo has been used in experiments where it plays role in cell therapy autologous cells can be altered to express tumor specific antigens these cells will then bind to tumors and induce apoptosis there are side effects associated with this kind of treatment and ipo can help to control those side effects suicide gene is needed to induce apoptosis in cells when needed cyp is inactive in humans but with minor changes in the amino acid sequence it can be activated again this would result in cell death when the cells are exposed to ipo because they metabolize ipo efficiently non toxic ipo analogues are also capable of inhibiting nicotine derived nitrosamine ketone nnk metabolism nnk is pre carcinogen which is activated inside the lung out of the four analogues tested hydroxy lphenyl pentanone hpp hydroxy phenyl octanone hpo hydroxy thienyl pentanone htp hydroxy pyridyl pentanone hpyp hpp and hpo showed competitive and noncompetitive inhibition of nnk and it reduces tumor formation in mice toxicity ipo is specific lethal toxicant which mainly targets bronchiolar exocrine cells in the smaller bronchioles of rodent and cattle lungs with an increased dosis it is also possible to affect other cells and the airway of organisms covalent binding of ipo to members of the cyp family mainly cyp eventually leads to of ipo into an enedial intermediate which is able to bind to variety of proteins these binding events are permanent and responsible for ipo toxicity this will result in cytotoxicity and eventually necrosis of bronchiolar exocrine cells while ciliated bronchiolar cells and other epithelial lung cells are not affected due to lower levels of cytochrome proteins necrotic patches also called lesions or primary pathological changes can develop into edemas resulting in thickening of the alveolar septum congestion and hemorrhage secondary and tertiary pathological changes lethality is probably due to pulmonary edema prior to death the dogs also showed rapid and shallow respiration while in rats labored respiration and lymphocyte depletion can be observed the ld dose varies between different species in female mice mg kg day ipo are sufficient while in male mice mg kg day were necessary mg kg ipo intravenously administered into rats is lethal and in dogs this dose is mg kg it is possible to increase the ld by fold when individuals are treated with multiple non toxic doses beforehand in humans ipo shows minimal effects in the lung because the enzymes needed for of ipo are not present instead the liver is affected because human liver cells do contain enzymes to biotransform ipo something similar can be observed in male mice apart from the effects seen in the lungs they also have certain enzymes in their kidney which can transform ipo into its reactive intermediate as result renal toxicity is observed female mice and immature male mice do not have these enzymes therefore they are resistant to renal toxicity effects on animals ipo has similar to humans toxic effect on animals it is toxic to livestock and many laboratory animals male rabbits mice rats and hamsters were used to test the effect of ipo on in all four species the lung was major target in the hamsters and mice additional liver necrosis and renal necrosis respectively was detected ipo can also threaten newborn calves if they become exposed to ipo it increases their susceptibility to bovine parainfluenza virus parainfluenza itself does not have severe health effects but together with other infections it can lead to complex enzootic pneumonia
